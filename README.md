# Construction Management System

A comprehensive full-stack application for managing construction projects, vendor relationships, and bidding processes. This system streamlines the complex workflow of construction project management by providing intuitive interfaces for tracking project progress, managing vendor quotes, and facilitating communication between project stakeholders.

## 🏗️ What This Application Does

This construction management system addresses the real-world challenges faced by construction project managers and owner representatives. The application provides:

**Project Management Dashboard**: A centralized view of all active construction projects with real-time status tracking, completion percentages, and deadline monitoring. Each project displays critical metrics like total estimated value, number of materials requiring quotes, and vendor participation rates.

**Vendor Relationship Management**: Tools for managing relationships with construction vendors, tracking their specialties, and maintaining contact information. The system supports vendor discovery and helps match the right vendors with specific project categories.

**Bidding Process Automation**: Streamlined workflows for requesting quotes from multiple vendors, comparing bids side-by-side, and tracking the progress of quote collection across different material categories.

**Category-Based Organization**: Projects are organized by material categories (like "Structural Steel" or "Windows & Glazing"), making it easier to manage complex projects with dozens of different material types and vendor relationships.

## 🏛️ System Architecture

This application follows a modern full-stack architecture that separates concerns between data management and user interface:

### Frontend (React)
The user interface is built using React with a component-based architecture that makes the application both maintainable and scalable. The frontend handles all user interactions and presents data in an intuitive dashboard format.

### Backend (FastAPI)
The server layer uses FastAPI, a modern Python web framework that provides automatic API documentation and high performance. The backend manages all data operations and business logic.

### Data Layer
The application uses JSON-based data storage for simplicity, making it easy to understand and modify the data structure during development.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running this application, you'll need to have these tools installed on your development machine:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher) - for running the React frontend
- **Python** (version 3.8 or higher) - for running the FastAPI backend
- **npm** or **yarn** - for managing JavaScript dependencies

### Installation and Setup

**Step 1: Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd construction-management-system
```

**Step 2: Set Up the Frontend**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

This will start the React development server on `http://localhost:3000`. The development server includes hot reloading, so you'll see changes immediately as you modify the code.

**Step 3: Set Up the Backend**
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

This starts the FastAPI server on `http://localhost:8000`. The `--reload` flag enables automatic restarting when you make changes to the Python code.

**Step 4: Verify Everything Works**
- Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the construction management dashboard
- Visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` to explore the interactive API documentation

### Component Organization

The frontend components are organized by functionality to make the codebase easy to navigate:

- **Dashboard Components**: Handle the main project overview
- **Project Components**: Manage detailed project views and category comparisons
- **Vendor Components**: Handle vendor relationship management
- **Shared Components**: Provide common UI elements like loading states and error handling

## 🔌 API Endpoints

The backend provides a RESTful API that the frontend uses to manage data:

### Project Management
- `GET /api/projects` - Retrieve all projects with calculated metrics
- `GET /api/projects/{project_id}` - Get detailed project information including categories and vendors

### Vendor Management
- `GET /api/vendors` - Retrieve all vendors from the catalog
- `GET /api/categories/{category_id}/vendors` - Get vendor information for a specific material category

### Health Check
- `GET /` - Verify that the API server is running correctly

You can explore all available endpoints interactively by visiting `http://localhost:8000/docs` when the backend server is running.

## 🎯 Understanding the Business Logic

This application models real construction industry workflows:

**Project Lifecycle**: Construction projects move through phases from initial planning to completion. The system tracks this progression and highlights projects that need attention.

**Vendor Relationships**: Construction relies heavily on vendor relationships. Different vendors specialize in different materials, and maintaining good relationships with reliable vendors is crucial for project success.

**Bidding Process**: Getting competitive quotes is essential for cost control. The system helps manage the complex process of requesting quotes from multiple vendors for many different material categories.

**Timeline Management**: Construction projects have strict deadlines. The system provides visual indicators to help project managers identify projects that need immediate attention.

## 🛠️ Development and Customization

The application is designed to be easily customizable for different construction management needs:

### Adding New Features
The modular component structure makes it straightforward to add new features. For example, you could add:
- Document management for storing project files
- Calendar integration for tracking important dates
- Reporting features for analyzing vendor performance
- Email integration for automated quote requests

### Modifying Data Structure
The JSON-based data storage makes it easy to modify the data structure. You can add new fields to projects, vendors, or categories by updating the JSON files and corresponding API endpoints.

### Styling and Branding
The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling, making it easy to customize colors, layouts, and branding to match your organization's requirements.

## 📊 Sample Data

The application includes realistic sample data to demonstrate its capabilities:

- **Three sample construction projects** ranging from office complexes to residential developments
- **Multiple vendor profiles** with different specialties and contact information
- **Various material categories** representing common construction materials
- **Quote and bidding data** showing different stages of the procurement process

This sample data helps you understand how the application works and provides a foundation for adding your own real project data.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Frontend won't start**: Make sure you're in the `frontend` directory and have run `npm install` to install dependencies.

**Backend API errors**: Verify that Python dependencies are installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt` and that you're running the server from the `backend` directory.

**CORS issues**: The backend is configured to accept requests from `http://localhost:3000`. If you're running the frontend on a different port, update the CORS configuration in `main.py`.

**Data not loading**: Check that both frontend and backend servers are running and that the API endpoints are accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.
